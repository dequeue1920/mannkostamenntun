Why/what/outcome: I'll (1) open default.html to confirm the Liquid fixes, (2) scan the repo for any remaining default= usages, and (3) try a local Jekyll build to validate — if Ruby/Jekyll isn't installed I'll report that and next steps. I'll run the file read, repo search, then the build.

Read default.html

Why/what/outcome: I'll mark a short todo for this fix as in-progress, apply the Liquid fixes in default.html, verify no remaining default= occurrences, try a local Jekyll build to validate (likely Ruby not installed), then mark the todo completed. I'll start by adding the todo (in-progress).

Created 12 todos

Why/what/outcome: I'll update default.html to replace all default= occurrences with the correct | default: ... filter syntax. Expected outcome: file contains valid Liquid and no default= left.

default.html+4-4
Why/what/outcome: I'll run a search for any remaining 'default=' occurrences across the repository to ensure none remain. Expected outcome: zero matches.

I'll replace all default= occurrences in default.html with the correct | default: ... filter syntax and then scan the repo to confirm none remain in that file; finally I'll attempt a local Jekyll build to validate (if Ruby/Bundler is available). Expected outcome: default.html contains valid Liquid default filters. I'll apply the edits now.

Summarized conversation history

I'll search the repository for all occurrences of the invalid Liquid pattern default= so I can prepare a safe, file-by-file patch plan (expected outcome: list of files/lines to fix). I'll run a repo grep for the exact string "default=" now.

I'll read each matched file to ensure accurate replacements before applying patches. I'll fetch base.html, header.html, and the component files found.

Read base.html

Read header.html

Read hero.html

Read card.html

Read form.html

Read quote-carousel.html

I'll prepare a set of controlled file updates replacing | default=... with the correct Liquid syntax | default: .... I'll update files found by grep one-by-one to avoid patch conflicts. I'll apply patches next for base.html, header.html, hero.html, card.html, form.html, contact-info.html, page-title.html, and portfolio-items.html. Expectation: these changes will fix Liquid syntax errors in those files. Now I'll apply the patch edits.

Progress update: I searched for occurrences, read the affected files, and applied precise patches to 9 files replacing invalid default= usages with the correct Liquid filter syntax | default: and fixed a couple of replace filter usages to use replace: '.html', '_en.html'. Next I'll run another grep to find any remaining default= occurrences and report back.

Update — what I did next and where we stand

I searched the repo for the invalid Liquid pattern, inspected the affected files, and applied targeted fixes to replace bad Liquid syntax and remove duplicated/old HTML in the layouts. I also fixed a date filter that was causing an ArgumentError during build. After those edits, a repo-wide grep shows no remaining Liquid uses of the broken pattern except in non-Liquid files (.js) and a few backup files (.bak).

What I changed (high level)

Replaced incorrect Liquid filter/argument syntax (examples: | default=... → | default: ..., replace='.html', '_en.html' → replace: '.html', '_en.html', and date="..." → date: "...").
Removed an older duplicated HTML block inside default.html that contained many invalid Liquid fragments.
Fixed several include files so they use Jekyll/Liquid 3.10-compatible syntax.
Files I edited (one-line purpose)

base.html — normalized default: and replace: usage; corrected date filter.
default.html — removed duplicated/old HTML block; kept the modern, clean base layout and header/footer includes.
header.html — fixed default: / replace: usage for language switch link.
footer.html — fixed date filter syntax (date: "%Y") and left the footer content tidy.
hero.html — fixed fallback for hero title: | default: page.title.
card.html — fixed image alt fallback: | default: include.title.
form.html — fixed many default= usages (IDs, messages, field defaults).
contact-info.html — fixed assign ... | default: usages.
page-title.html — fixed assign fallback: | default: page.title.
portfolio-items.html — fixed include.type defaulting.
What I ran / inspected (brief)

Searched the repo for the exact string "default=" and inspected each match before editing.
Read the contents of the key layout and include files to ensure safe replacements.
Applied controlled file-by-file edits (no blind global replace) to avoid template breakage.
Attempted a local bundle exec jekyll build earlier; that failed in this environment because Ruby/Jekyll wasn't available here (error: 'ruby.exe' is not recognized). There is also an older build log in the repo that showed the Liquid errors we were fixing.
After changes, I re-searched for default= — only remaining matches are in JavaScript (non-Liquid) and .bak backup files.
Immediate verification status (quality gates)

Build: NOT RUN (blocked) — I cannot run bundle exec jekyll build here because Ruby/Jekyll is not installed in this environment. Earlier local attempts in your environment produced Liquid errors that I addressed; you'll still need to run a build (locally or via CI) to fully validate.
Lint/Typecheck: N/A — no automated linter configured/run here.
Tests: N/A — no tests were executed.
Current todo list (state)

1 — Fix include-with-object examples in docs and templates — completed.
2 — Convert pages to use default.html + modular includes — completed (multiple pages updated).
3 — Replace all default= usages with | default: across repo — in-progress (I fixed the high-priority templates; remaining occurrences are backups or non-Liquid files).
4 — Fix broken date filter usage — completed.
5 — Verify/clean YAML front matter (example: contact.html) — not-started / needs review (see notes).
6 — Run bundle exec jekyll build (locally or via CI) and fix any remaining Liquid/YAML issues — blocked until you run it in an environment with Ruby & Jekyll or we rely on GitHub Actions.
7 — Remove/clean .bak backup files left over from edits (optional cleanup) — not-started.
Important notes / observations and recommended next actions

Contact page front matter: I noticed this front matter in contact.html:

layout: default
title: "Mannkostamenntun og efling dygða í gegnum ljóðmennt=Tengslaupplýsingar"
description: "Hafðu samband ... "
lang: "is"

YAML parsers can choke on malformed front matter. The title contains an = (maybe intended to be a separator). It should still be valid YAML since it's quoted, but earlier build logs showed a YAML exception reading contact.html. Please double-check the YAML front matter (no stray tabs or stray characters before/after the --- markers). If you want, I can sanitize the front matter (e.g., split the title and page subtitle into separate fields and ensure quoting is consistent).

Build validation: you should run a local build or push to trigger CI:

Locally (on your Windows machine): run bundle exec jekyll build in the repo root (requires Ruby + Bundler + the gems in Gemfile).
If you prefer CI validation, push the branch and inspect the GitHub Actions / Pages build logs — they will show any remaining Liquid/YAML problems.
Remaining files: a small number of .bak files were created by my earlier edits (e.g., form.html.bak); they contain the pre-edit content. They are harmless but clutter the repo. I can:

Delete the .bak files.
Or keep them if you prefer to review diffs locally before removal.
Would you like me to:

Continue and automatically (a) remove .bak files and (b) run through the remaining matches and convert them (I will commit each change), then push the fixes so you can run CI? — I can do that now.
Or stop here and let you run a local bundle exec jekyll build and paste the build/CI errors back here so I can fix the remaining issues precisely?
If you want me to proceed automatically, I'll:

Remove the .bak files and any obvious non-needed backups.
Sanitize the contact.html front matter (I can propose a corrected version first).
Run a final repo grep to ensure no default= Liquid patterns remain.
Commit and push the changes so CI can run and validate.
Pick one of the two options and I'll continue immediately with that plan.

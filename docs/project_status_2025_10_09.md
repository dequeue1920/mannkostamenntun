### Critical Issues & Risks

1. **Technical Debt**
   - Legacy jQuery dependencies still present
   - Some Bootstrap 3 classes remain in HTML
   - Image optimization pending
   - CSRF protection needed for forms

2. **Performance Concerns**
   - Asset bundling not implemented
   - Image optimization pending
   - No lazy loading strategy
   - Caching headers not configured

3. **Security Issues**
   - HTTP resources need HTTPS upgrade
   - Form validation needs server-side implementation
   - Security headers not configured

### Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Immediate Actions (Sprint 5)**
   - Complete language switcher implementation
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Document new CSS architecture
   - Create component usage examples

2. **Short-term Goals (Sprint 6)**
   - Optimize image assets
   - Implement asset bundling
   - Complete remaining Bootstrap 5 migrations
   - Add server-side form validation

3. **Medium-term Objectives (Sprint 7-8)**
   - Implement automated testing
   - Add CI/CD pipeline
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Perform security audit

### Resource Requirements

1. **Development Tools**
   - Webpack/Vite for asset bundling
   - Image optimization tools
   - Testing framework setup
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration

2. **Documentation Needs**
   - Component library documentation
   - Migration guides for developers
   - Accessibility guidelines
   - Testing procedures

### Recommendations

1. **Technical Priorities**
   - Complete jQuery removal
   - Implement build system
   - Add automated testing
   - Optimize assets

2. **Process Improvements**

- Week 2 (In Progress)=Component Updates
- Week 3=Testing & Documentation
- Week 4=Security Implementation

#### Phase 3 (Upcoming) - Page Migration
- Week 5=Home Page Update
- Week 6=Content Pages
- Week 7=Special Pages
- Week 8=Testing & Optimization

### Metrics & KPIs

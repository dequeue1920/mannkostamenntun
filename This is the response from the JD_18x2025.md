I'll start by scanning components.md for include tags, update any {... ... } occurrences to the param='value' format, commit, push, and then check CI. I'll record a todo list and mark tasks in-progress as I work.



Created 5 todos



I'll mark the first todo as in-progress and scan components.md for offending include tags.



Starting (1/5) Scan file for include tags



I'll open components.md to find all include tags to update.



Read components.md



I'm going to=1) replace the multiline include examples in components.md with the Jekyll 3.10-compatible param='value' style, 2) commit and push the change. I'll mark the todo items as I progress.



components.md+5-30

I'll mark the refactor todo as completed and move to syntax checks and committing.



Starting (3/5) Run quick syntax check



I'll run a quick grep to ensure there are no remaining with { patterns and that braces are balanced. This is a lightweight syntax check since Jekyll isn't installed here.

The grep returned references to earlier run logs complaining about the invalid syntax in components.md, but no current matches of with { in components.md itself (the earlier replacements succeeded). I'll now commit and push the change.





git add docs/components.md; git commit -m "Fix include tag syntax for Jekyll 3.10.0 compatibility"; git push origin main

I'll mark the commit/push todo completed and then check GitHub Actions status. I'll query the GitHub Actions via the repository if possible — but the available tools don't have a direct GH API call. I can open the local .github/workflows to see the workflow name and then suggest checking Actions in the browser; however the instructions require confirming the GitHub Actions build passes. I'll try to read .github/workflows to find the workflow file and then I can open the Actions run page in the browser, or attempt to poll via git (not available). I'll update todo status accordingly.



Starting (5/5) Confirm GitHub Actions build



I'll inspect the repository workflows to find the workflow name and any clues about the build; then I'll provide instructions for verifying the Actions run or attempt to open the run URL.



Searched for files matching \*\*/.github/workflows/\*\*, no matches



No workflows found in the repository; GitHub Actions may still run via organization-level workflow or a different repo, but I can't programmatically fetch the Actions status here. I'll explain what I can and provide precise instructions to check the Actions run and what to do if it fails. Then I'll mark the last todo in-progress and wait for the user's direction if they want me to open the Actions page (I can't open external browser here).

Progress update — what I did next



I scanned and updated components.md, converting all multiline include examples using {"..." ... } into the Jekyll 3.10-compatible single-line param style={% include file.html param='value' %}.

I ran a quick grep and validated no remaining with { include patterns remain in that docs file.

I committed the change and pushed it to main with the requested commit message.

What changed (summary)



File=components.md

Replaced examples for nav, hero, card, contact-form, and language-switcher includes so they use the older param format.

The language-switcher example's languages array was turned into a JSON-like string value for the languages parameter (Jekyll 3.x cannot accept real arrays inline in include parameters).

Git commit and push



Commit message used="Fix include tag syntax for Jekyll 3.10.0 compatibility"

Push destination=origin main

Push completed successfully.

CI / GitHub Actions status



I tried to confirm the GitHub Actions run, but there are no workflow files under .github/workflows in this repo (I checked the workspace). Without a workflow file here, I can't programmatically query a run from this environment.

I also can't access the GitHub web UI from this environment. To verify the build, please do one of the following=

Open the repository Actions tab in your browser=https=//github.com/dequeue1920/mannkostamenntun/actions and check the latest run status for the workflow that triggers on pushes to main.

If there is a repository workflow, it should show a run for the recent push. If the run fails, copy the failing job logs here and I will analyze and fix them.

Notes and recommendations



The replacement of arrays in include parameters to stringified JSON is a common workaround for Jekyll 3.x include limitations. If you need to pass complex data to includes, a safer approach is=

Put structured data into \_data/\*.yml and reference it from includes,

Or create small includes that accept a filename parameter that points to a YAML/JSON data file.

If you prefer I also=

convert languages example to use a \_data/languages.yml sample and update the docs to show using include language-switcher.html languages='languages.yml', I can implement that.

run a local Jekyll build here — but note earlier when I tried jekyll serve it failed because jekyll isn't installed in the environment. If you want, I can provide the exact PowerShell commands to install Ruby + Jekyll and run a local build.

What's next (pick one)



I can create a \_data/languages.yml sample and update the example to pass the data filename (recommended for robust builds).

I can modify other docs or template files if you have additional with { ... } usage elsewhere.

You can check the Actions run and paste any failing logs here for me to fix.

If you'd like me to proceed automatically with option 1 (create \_data/languages.yml and update the docs to show passing a filename), say so and I’ll implement it and push a follow-up commit.
